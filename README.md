# Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals Self-study Project
This repository tracks my self-study of the book "Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals." 

I'm still undecided about which programming language to use, though Julia might be a better option.

As a second-year PhD student with a Master's in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, I have mixed feelings. One concern is that traditional healthcare epidemiology might soon be supplanted by AI. Additionally, I lack knowledge in mathematical modeling, which I believe will become increasingly important. Motivated by my attendance at the MONID conference in Berlin from February 26th to 28th 2025, I decide to enhance my skills in infectious disease modeling, which is the purpose of this project.
