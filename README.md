# Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals Self-study Project
This repository tracks my self-study of the book "Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals." 

Both Julia and R are used for computation. 

As a second-year PhD student with a Master's in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, I have mixed feelings. One concern is that traditional healthcare epidemiology might soon be supplanted by AI. Additionally, I lack knowledge in mathematical modeling, which I believe will become increasingly important. Motivated by my attendance at the MONID conference in Berlin from February 26th to 28th 2025, I decide to enhance my skills in infectious disease modeling, which is the purpose of this project.

How will the book be used? I want to use the cases and models mentioned in the book and fit the models myself to better understand the application areas of different models. If the data used in the papers are not accessible, similar simulated data will be used. For each chapter, several papers will be highlighted. Please refer to the README file for each chapter.
